# KSP-Mun-rush

Hurry up!  
Money is scarce.  
Scientific research is unspeakably late.  
And you have to plant your flag on the Mun.  
Will you be up to it?  

## Targeted audience
This mod/scenario is targeted for players already familiar with BTSM and wanting to try something more chalenging at tech level 6.

## Features
- Equilibrium between time, fund and tech research.
- Add on of several parts and modifications of some pieces to prevent some technologies from being mandatory.
- Add on photographic contracts, to gain funds & upgrade points (for Kerbal Construction Time).
- Restriction of the number of experiments per probe core (instruments need housing).
- Scientific instruments can break (20-30% chance, but never twice in a row)
- An engine can only start a number of time, according to his number of "igniter" resource.
- [normal & hard difficulty only] Need to test engines at ground before using them (consume time)

** This scenario needs (for the time being) a dedicated intallation of KSP **

## Tips (should be read):
### New game:
- Don't create new career, go to "scenario" and use "new" or "continnue".
- "Easy" begins with 3 free technologies
- "Normal" begins with 2 free technologies, and we need to test engines (and parachutes)
- "Hard" begins with 1 free technology, and we need to test engines (and parachutes)
- After loading, use your upgrade points: choose between production speed or research speed (research speed more useful if easy/normal scenario)

### Scientific instruments & research:
- you have access to enough science to get 3 other science nodes. Gravity mesures, a mirror to land on the Mun, 'goo' to bring at a fly-by near the Mun are the three main source of science.
- When accepting the "Plant a flag on the Mun! Hurry up!", some experimental parts appear on research nodes.
- Scientific intruments must be put on the probe core (or the command pod) to gather their "science slot". It's mandatory to keep them in working condition. The science slot is consumed at liftoff.
- When activating themometer, barometer and gravimometer (for gathering science), the instrument can break. Failing chances are between 22 and 35% (depending on difficulty).
- Each type of breakable instrument cannot break two times in a row on the same vessel. There are two sequences that are not possible: break->break, and break->success->success->break .
- Be carefull when activating the instrument (gathering science): it can break your instrument even if no science is gathered. Check twice the vessel situation and biome (it's displayed on the screen) against your science check list.
- Some experiments have already been done. Check against this cheat-sheet (made by [creepyD](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/61632-0-23-5-Better-Than-Starting-Manned-Career-Mode-Redefined-%28v1-56-May-7th%29/page204?p=984915#post984915) for btsm): [link](https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=24b14eb57322c2f4&id=24B14EB57322C2F4!147) (note: fill experiments already done in this scenario). You have to add the mirror experiment (landed on the moon, for 150 science)
- Mystery Goo is special: operable only via eva, can't break and result can be transmit via an antenna.

### Engine start limit:
- When staging an engine, it consumes an igniter.
- When throttling to 0, the engine stops. So you can't throttle down to the minimum thrust of your engine (be carefull). 
- When you start your engine without an igniter available, its isp is 50 times less powerful (it's venting your precious fuel in the deep space). It's easy to notice: there are no more exhaust flames.

### Engine and parachute testing [normal and hard difficulties only]:
- To do a test, you need to create a vessel with an antenna and some "test instrument" resources.
- The testing level of each engine is displayed on the contextual menu (right-clic).
- Testing engines at ground level is enough, you don't need to test them in space.
- To test the parachute, it must be activated via staging (no need to test it at an higher altitude than ground level: it's a work in progress).
