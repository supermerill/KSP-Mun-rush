	description = The reflex Vac-000 is our first attempt to afford to take pictures of our natural satellite from the vacuum of space. Avoid using all the negatives by taking selfies. It's configured in burst trigger mode, so it will consume all the science slots not already reclaimed. Consume 800 electric charge to compress and emit the pictures.
